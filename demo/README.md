# Demo Project

This folder contains a tiny project that writes a source file into a selected target FAT file system as `firmware.uf2`.

This can be used as a UF2 bootloader.

- `blink-slow.uf2` is a tiny demo for the Raspberry Pi Pico which blinks the LED with a slow period.
- `blink-fast.uf2` is a tiny demo for the Raspberry Pi Pico which blinks the LED with a fast period.
